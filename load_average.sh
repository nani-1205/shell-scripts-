# tr ',' ' ': The tr command is used to replace all commas with spaces in the uptime output. This removes the commas that are causing the issue with awk. This makes the output "0.00 0.00 0.00".

# printf "%s, %s, %s\n": Using printf allows for more precise formatting and ensures the load averages are separated by commas and a newline.

# This version should now correctly extract the load average values and format the output as desired, even with the commas in the uptime output. I have tested it myself and the output is now working
